  ❓ More about me!
  
  <br>
  
   <b><i>I like to code with HTML, CSS, and I can (somewhat) code with C# and XML.
  <br>
 Then again, I'm still learning C# and XML, if that isn't obvious enough as is.
  <br>
 I do hope to make a simple 16-bit OS soemday using C++, and other programming languages, and I hope that can happen one day.
  <br>
 You can follow me for updates on my repositories, and star my repositories.
  <br>
   Have a good day! :)</i></b>
